1.1.8

Proper bug fix for Triggering error reported


v1.0.5

BlueIris version 5 only
- Add Action Group to change Macro
e.g. update Temp/Location/Information Macros as needed from within Indigo
These then overlay on the video
Support Device and Variable Substition
eg.
%%d:241092027:clipsInfo%%

BI supports 1-100 Macros, only 1-10 shown in settings.
Within Video Settings, Overlay settings, add text and add %1 for Macro One etc.

1.0.8

- Add Motion Camera sensing by Log messaging (Resets within 20 seconds or so
Current alert from within BI for each camera still prefered, faster and also sends motion off.
But if haven't set up this will work almost as well.

1.1.0

- Add optional new device Blueiris user - updated with user information, including login details
- Add Trigger User Login: Unrelated to above device, can trigger when any BI Users login to the service
(add optional push trigger notification later

1.1.5
- Few fixes for Server errors for Log Message Parsing
- Add User Alert for immediate User Login Notification
Format:
IndigoIPAddress:4556/&CAM/&TYPE/&PROFILE/glenn
Same as other alerts - just change the last item to correct name of user.

- Risks two triggers if have both Alert Group in Camera set as above, and Parsing Log running within Plugin.

As will trigger immediately with alert being sent, and then again when log parsed a few seconds later and login found.

To resolve:
Will check Indigo BI User device for time of last log in and not trigger if within last 15 seconds
If have both Action Group set, and Parsing log without Indigo BI User device then may trigger twice.
If issue - create Indigo BI User Device for appropriate user.

- Change to User Login - will alert with or without the BI User Device being created
(Benefit of Device is will show time etc of login

- Add optional disable of BI server log parsing (as can do everything with Camera based alerts - better, slightly quicker, just more setup


1.1.6

Bug fixes for non-admin users within BI Server.
Cosmetic changes with Plugin Config
Preferred option would be always admin user, and limit to local-LAN access only if any concerns.

(Soon to try new AI Dahua IVS cameras to see if anything special
