Within a minute or two will create BlueIris Camera Devices within a New Folder - called 'BlueIris' if it exists - or the main directory.
These are your cameras and decide the options currently available for actions. The cameras have a whole pile of custom states listing what is happening. This is updated every 5 minutes or so.

However - there are Multiple Action Groups created which can be selected for each camera, from Ptz, contrast, select preset, IR on off etc.

Quite a bit more to come; but more than happy to take suggestions.
